In examining any piece of science fiction, considering the context of the work, whether historical, cultural, philosophical, etc., is of the utmost importance. “Literature & the Future” is missing a text that accurately reflects the context of _today_; that is, a text should be included that is representative of the way that our society and culture presently thinks of futurity. The TV show _Rick and Morty_, specifically the episode “Rixty Minutes,” is the best candidate for a text of this nature. Humanity is now living in “the future” that the thinkers discussed in class speculated about in the past, so it is desirable to consider what the concept of futurity means in an age where humans are simultaneously more connected and isolated than ever before. In essence, “Rixty Minutes” should be included as a “missing text” for the class syllabus because it self-reflexively offers a metamodern, integrative worldview as a solution for the crisis of human existence as it presently exists in the age of technology.

### What is _Rick and Morty_?

_Rick and Morty_ follows the titular characters Rick Sanchez, an elderly, alcoholic, supergenius scientist, and Morty Smith, his naive but well-meaning grandson, on their adventures through the multiverse. The show appears to take place in the present or not-too-distant future (or at least on a version of Earth resembling our own, technologically and culturally), but the character of Rick serves as the bridge between present and future by nature of his unparalleled intelligence and scientific knowledge. The multiverse of _Rick and Morty_ is rather uniquely constructed. There are an infinite number of realities/timelines/universes all existing in parallel; it remains unclear whether the infinity of realities is due to some branching from the initial seeds of creation or whether they all have been always happening in parallel. Time travel apparently does not exist, and the progression of time seems fixed across universes (although relativity and its time-warping effects assumably still exist in each universe). Therefore, all of the alternate versions of Rick and Morty and other characters in the show encountered through interdimensional travel are the same age and have roughly the same appearance. Rick is the smartest being in the universe and the inventor and sole possessor of interdimensional travel. More precisely, each Rick is the smartest being in his universe and the sole possessor of interdimensional travel in that universe. The show primarily follows the Rick and Morty from dimension C-137, although some episodes, such as “Total Rickall,” showcase alternate Ricks and Mortys.

So much of the construction and even specific narratives of the show are directly in conversation with texts that have been examined in class. _Rick and Morty_’s multiverse, fundamental to the construction of the show and appearing in every episode in one form or another, already puts the show in conversation with texts from class such as Borges’ “The Garden of Forking Paths.” Besides its construction of the multiverse and Rick’s unique ability to travel through it, classic topics in science fiction have been covered in various episodes, including simulated realities (“M. Night Shaym-Aliens!”), dreams (“Lawnmower Dog”), time (“A Rickle In Time”), and memory (“Morty’s Mind Blowers”). However, _Rick and Morty_ is most significant not for the specific science fictional narratives it covers on an episode-to-episode basis, but instead for how those narratives highlight psychological and philosophical issues innate to the human condition and present an integrative worldview as a solution to these problems.

As discussed in class, science fiction has historically been more driven by setting than by character (although many works, some of which have been covered in class, have of course reversed this traditional dichotomy). In _Rick and Morty_, all realities are not only occurring simultaneously but also accessible by the protagonists, exponentiating the sense of isolation and meaninglessness increasingly apparent in the real world with greater scientific understanding of the universe and humanity’s place within it. The details of any setting encountered are secondary to the characters’ response to it. The construction of Rick and Morty thus inherently emphasizes character and psychology over setting. This emphasis has even been mentioned explicitly by the show’s creators, Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, in an interview:

>**Dan Harmon**: “That’s an interesting question. My philosophy with sci-fi is to focus more on the ‘fi’ than the ‘sci.’ I think people like it when it holds up a little bit to logical scrutiny. But that logic can often be pretty magically enforced…. I think what’s more important to sci-fi is that people recognize a mythologized version of something they have encountered in their lives….”
>
>**Justin Roiland**: “Dan does a great job too, of taking a sci-fi concept and grounding it in a really awesome, structurally stable, narrative. It’s more character based. You’re really putting yourself in the shoes of somebody when you’re watching the show. You’re really relating and connecting with somebody’s decision or choice or adventure.”[^1]

Additionally, the show particularly highlights the themes of mental illness and isolation, mirroring the obsession of science today with matters of mind. It seems to deny (or at least question) science’s ability to answer the deepest mysteries of mind and mental illness by giving Rick essentially infinite knowledge (and therefore abilities), therefore blurring the distinction between human and god, while constantly highlighting the uselessness of his knowledge or abilities in solving his existential burden and deep depression.

However, the most salient justification for the inclusion of an episode of _Rick and Morty_ in the class syllabus is not the actual science fictional concepts the show uses. Instead, it is that the show uses these concepts in an inherently metamodern way and therefore offers a conception of futurity and science fiction not covered by the syllabus—the _current_ conception. Before analyzing the metamodernity of _Rick and Morty_, however, the concept of metamodernism must first be understood.

### An Aside: Postmodernism and Metamodernism

While the term “metamodernism” is relatively new and possibly unfamiliar, postmodernism has long been prevalent, if ill-defined: “Defining postmodernism… is a notoriously difficult endeavor, and there are plenty of elitist guardians at the gate telling us we will never succeed.”[^2] (Bishop and Starkey 131). Postmodernism arose as a departure from modernism, the dominant cultural philosophy of the first half of the twentieth century that emphasized innovation and reason. The difficulty in defining postmodernism is that it encompasses countless and often contradictory approaches, but Timeotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker highlight the similarities between these disparate approaches:

>However, what these distinct phenomena share is an opposition to ‘‘the’’ modern—to utopism, to (linear) progress, to grand narratives, to Reason, to functionalism and formal purism, and so on. These positions can most appropriately be summarized, perhaps, by Jos de Mul’s distinction between postmodern irony (encompassing nihilism, sarcasm, and the distrust and deconstruction of grand narratives, the singular and the truth) and modern enthusiasm (encompassing everything from utopism to the unconditional belief in Reason).
