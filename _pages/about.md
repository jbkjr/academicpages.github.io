I am a senior at Yale College majoring in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Computer Science. I do NLP research under the supervision of Professor Dragomir Radev in the Language, Information, and Learning at Yale (LILY) Lab. I plan to pursue a PhD in Computer Science/Machine Learning and hope to one day work on AI safety and alignment.
